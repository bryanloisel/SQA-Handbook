# Code Reviews
## What is a code review?
Code Review, also known as Peer Code Review, is the act of consciously and systematically convening with one’s fellow programmers to check each other’s code for mistakes ([SmartBear](https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/what-is-code-review/)) Code reviews are an essential part of the software development process. This is where fellow developers will potentially write comments in the code or potentially provide critique or advise for improvement

## Why use Code Review
- It promotes best practices to be maintained and followed consistently
- Allows for developers to educate each other on new code
- Reduces the "bus factor" issue from the project. this is where a large amount of knowledge, skill or information is not shared by the majority of the team.
- Allows for discussion and the sharing of ideas

## Steps to use to Review Code
1. Figure out what the code is supposed to be doing. Do you understand the purpose of the code and what it should be doing
2. Frame your mind: Understand your position as a reviewer and your level of competency in this given field. Understand your level of experience, whether you have written code similar to this etc.
3. Test code. Simply run the code and see if it does what it is supposed to do. check if it generates errors, if there are additional steps required etc
4. Inspect the code. See if the code follows correct naming conventions, if files are named properly and if it follows the company coding standard
5. Compile your review. This can vary based on the situation. It could be writing a formal document or as simple as speaking to the developer themselves
