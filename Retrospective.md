## What were the postive aspects of the project ?
- We worked well together and communicated well throughout the task
- Considering there were only two of us, we were happy with the efficiency of the project
- We learned how to use markdown effectively
- We both were willing and ready to pull our weight despite the confusion and the smaller group size
- 
 
## What were the negatives?
- We left it a bit late to complete the task due to confusion over the submission date
- We both work part time so it was a challenge to set up meeting times 
 
## What would you do differently next time ?
- We would start the project earlier and work more incrementally
- A better understanding of the branching and forking process would help greatly
- Better and more efficient use of git flow(we learned from this assignment so we could use it next time)
