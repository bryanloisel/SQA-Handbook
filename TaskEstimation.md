# Task Estimation

## What is Task Estimation in Scrum ?

Task estimation is a rather simple concept to understand. It is simply the process of estimating the amount of time and effort that will be required for a particular project. This estimation results in a value which could be in hours, days, months or even years

When carrying out task estimation, the following points should be considered:

- the required steps
- the basic amount of time to complete each step
- the dependencies for the steps
- the factors that may affect the timing
- who else needs to be involved and how much time it will take them
- the risks that could impact our estimates to determine contingencies
