# Project Plan
 
## Introduction
 
Our goal for this handbook is to give Loisel & Keppel Software an effective tool in order to ensure that all of our developers follow best practices with regards to project planning and implementation. This project should benefit our existing team but also will help newer developers in Loisel & Keppel Software better understand what our expectations are and to ensure that they know what is expected of them. Proper planning and procedure is vital when it comes to building reliable software. With this handbook, all members in Loisel & Keppel Software should understand the benefits that best coding practices offer to a software company.
 
## Project Tasks
- Task Estimation in Scrum
- Coding Standards
- Code Reviews
 
Myself and Bryan had a meeting on Teams to structure the project, running through the different required tasks and deciding how we were going to split responsibilities. With only two members in our group, it was easy to delegate tasks. Once we decided who was doing what, we had a quick conversation about Github to make sure we knew how to use it properly. Bryan created the project and I forked it, setting up a development branch where our first drafts will be written.
 
- Introduction = Bryan and Mark
- Task Estimation in Scrum = Bryan and Mark
- Coding Standards = Bryan and Mark
- Code Reviews = Bryan and Mark
 
Our first meeeting was on Wednesday 16th March. We decided that our first pushes would happen on Friday 18th March. Once these tasks are complete, we will have a second meeting and decide when and how we are going to complete the final part of the project.
 
## Bryan & Marks Plan for Task Estimation in Scrum Task
- Have a call in order to determine the factors of task estimation and split the factors amongst ourselves
- Search the internet for informatio regarding our own parts of this section of the project
 
 
## Bryan and Marks Plan for Coding Standards Task
- Meeting at some stage early next week to discuss which standards we would like to use and the length that each standard should be
- Research of relevant material i.e images, blogs, website and quotes that would be beneficial to the handbook
 
## Whole Group for Coding Reviews
- We will decide what to do for this part at a later stage
